# nullplatform_approval_action_policy_association (Resource)

The `approval_action_policy_association` resource manages a **one-to-one relationship** between an approval action and a policy. It ensures that each approval action is associated with only a single policy at any given time.

~> **Ignore policies** When attaching policies using this resource, make sure to **ignore the `policies` property** in the `nullplatform_approval_action` resource. <br /><br />- Example:`lifecycle { ignore_changes = [policies] }`<br /><br />Failing to do so may result in an **infinite diff loop** and persistent plan changes during Terraform runs. For more details, see the [Terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-lifecycle#ignore-changes).
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    nullplatform = {
      source = "nullplatform/nullplatform"
    }
  }
}

provider "nullplatform" {}

resource "nullplatform_approval_action" "action" {
  nrn        = "organization=1:account=2:namespace=3:application=123"
  entity     = "deployment"
  action     = "deployment:create"
  dimensions = {
    environment = "prod"
  }
  on_policy_success = "approve"
  on_policy_fail    = "deny"
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [policies]
  }
}

resource "nullplatform_approval_policy" "policy" {
  nrn        = "organization=1:account=2:namespace=3:application=123"
  name       = "Memory <= 4Gb"
  conditions = jsonencode({
    "scope.requested_spec.memory_in_gb" = {
      "$lte" = 4
    }
  })
}

resource "nullplatform_approval_action_policy_association" "association" {
  approval_action_id = nullplatform_approval_action.action.id
  approval_policy_id = nullplatform_approval_policy.policy.id
}
```
